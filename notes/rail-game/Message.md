Things to encourage
- Spreading out
- Resource diversity
- “Robust” network
- Use of complex production change

Things to discourage
- Connecting everything directly to everything
- Only splitting at cities
- Building factories at resources
- Polluting processes

Mechanics
- ~~Space limitation?~~
  - ~~Large buildings~~
- High route costs?
- Population immigration and emigration
- Opt-in complexity
  - Toggleable climate impact?


Why aren’t factories built next to mines in the real world?
- Logistics of people
- Encourage people to move via good prices
- Long term benefit thinking

Because people need goods
- Complex set of goods
- People won’t move where it’s too costly to live or goods aren’t available
- 

# Game message 1: Resource exploitation/depletion

Mechanics
- Resources nodes deplete eventually
- Pollution? Crops/health impacted?
- Global warming?
- More efficient resource usage via more complex logistics
  - Lower pollution processes, but more complex resources/more steps/etc.
- Exploitation of waste processes
	- Way to include heat?

# Game message 2: Think long term (Strategy over tactics)

Mechanics
- Evaluation that isn’t just growth/money?
  - Somehow negatively score short-term decisions
  - Set or choose from a set of goals (benefit if success)
    - Lower costs?
    - Lower environmental impact?
    - Compare performance
    - Player makes meaning from metrics?
- Some sort of regular reporting
  - Climate projections?
- Requirement for scaling?
- Find _thing driving demand_
  - Way of finding causal link
- Operate on large time scale

# Simplest game that expresses these themes and mechanics?

Player
- Map view
- Construction tools

~~Competitor?~~
- ~~Same rules+capabilities as player~~

World generation
- Terrain height
- ~~Ocean + rivers~~
- Mineable resources, some renew automatically
  - Iron, limestone, fish
  - Fish has logistic growth and can be destroyed through over-farming
- Arability (random)
  - Different crops by latitude/height/climate
- Basic production chains where cheapest

Economic simulation
- Cities where resources cheap
- Non-train resource transportation
  - “Trucks” (wagons, horse, whatever)
  - Ships
  - Personal?
  - Immigration

Features
- Track building
  - Point-to-point or free-form?
  - Place stations
- Train routing
- Automatic delivery pricing
